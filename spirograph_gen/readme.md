###Spirographs!
This is a project that uses a set of trigonometric parametric occasions in order to mimmic the output of spirograph toys.

The important parameters for spirograph generation are the radii of the two "gears" (see image), as well as the distance from the "hole where the pen is inserted" to the center of the small gear. In the code, we set 'r' equal to the radius of the small gear, 'R' equal to the radius of the large gear, and 'l' equal to the distance from the hole where the pen is inserted to the center of the small gear.
